# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera
### [Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

This is my personal project for the course. The course covers deep learning from beginner level to advanced. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to break into AI. Also note that this is strictly for future reference of the algorithms only and plagerism of the answers violates the policies of Coursera.

I would like to thank [captainspockears](https://github.com/Captainspockears) for providing the notes for this course and making necessary changes.
