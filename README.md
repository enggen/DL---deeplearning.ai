## Quiz Solutions

There are concerns that some people may use the content here to quickly ace the course. I wanted to tell you that you can attempt it as many times you like and you will never grab the concepts if you just try to have good score which doesn't even reflect anywhere (Remember knowledge is far important than some certificate to achieve you dreams) instead **use this key with explanation as a last resort if you dont understand why you are wrong.**
